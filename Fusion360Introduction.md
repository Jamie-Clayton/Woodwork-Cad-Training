# Objective

Understand the basic workflow required to design and model your desired product. Use the software tool to help determine the cut list and required dimensions for the object.

## Constraints

Dimensions (use these as little as possible)
Joints to connect components together

Project to surface - mirror -

## Surfaces

The sketch surface is important for enabling the extrusions to go in the appropriate directions.  To modify the plane associated with a sketch, locate it in the timeline -> Right click -> Redefine Sketch plane.

## Combining Objects

Solid -> Modify -> Combine.
Provides a way to join or cut components, so you don't have to repeat effort in two components.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

* D - Add a dimension to a sketch
* S + keyboard - Show Sketch menu to search for options
* Q E - Extrude sketch

## Naming Objects

* [Frames and Panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_and_panel)
* [Rabbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbet) - Cut on the edge of material to create a ledge for joining.
* [Dado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_(joinery)) - Slot, housing, trench, cut perpendicular with the grain.
